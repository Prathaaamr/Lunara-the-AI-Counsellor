# Lunara-the-AI-Counsellor
"Professor Lunara" serves as an AI counsellor for students. It maintains a chat history, allowing users to submit queries and receive empathetic responses generated by the Ollama model. Each interaction is displayed in the chat interface, creating a supportive environment for students during exam preparation.

Code Explanation
Main Components
Imports: The application imports the necessary libraries, namely streamlit for the web interface and ollama for AI interactions.

Streamlit Page Setup:

The page title and icon are set using st.set_page_config.
A title "Professor Lunara" is displayed using st.title.
Session State Management:

The chat history is stored in st.session_state.messages to persist messages between app reruns.
Display Chat History:

The chat history is displayed by iterating through st.session_state.messages and rendering each message with appropriate roles (user or assistant).
Response Generation Function:

The generate_response function customizes the system message to define the role and tone of the AI.
It takes a user prompt, sends it to the Ollama model, and returns the generated response.
User Input Handling:

A chat input box allows users to type their messages.
User messages are appended to the session state and displayed immediately.
The assistant's response is generated and displayed below the user input.
